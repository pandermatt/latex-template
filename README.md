# LaTeX template for scientific work

[![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/pandermatt/latex-template/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pandermatt/latex-template/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is my LaTeX template that I have used over several years of study to write some beautiful academic papers.

## How to use

* `.github/workflows/main.yml`: runs a GitHub action to compile the LaTeX file
* `build.sh`: run the LaTeX compilation locally
* `chapters/1-einleitung.tex`: shows some important LaTeX commands
```latex
This is an acronym \gls{WWW}
This is a glossary entry \gls{Unsupervised Learning}
This is a citation for a website~\cite{website:this_repo}.

\todo[inline]{Use me to add Todos to the document. You can disable me in the main file}
```

Check out [Version 1.0](https://github.com/pandermatt/latex-template/releases/tag/1.0) for a german version of the template.
